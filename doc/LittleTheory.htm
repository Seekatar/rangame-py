<h4>A Little Theory</h4>
  <p>This all started years ago when I saw a NOVA special about Chaos.  They told a little story like this... &quot;Take a piece of paper and put three points on it, 
  in a triangle. Label the points 1, 2, and 3. Now close your eyes and randomly put a point somewhere on the page. Next take your three sided die and roll 
  it. Draw another point half way from your random point, and the point you rolled. (If you rolled a 3 go half way to point three from your random point.) 
  Now roll the die again and go half way to the next point from your last point.<br/> Keep doing this and see what you get. To speed things up, we've had a 
  computer simulate this and let's take a look.&quot;</p> <CENTER><p><IMG SRC="random4.gif" HEIGHT=296 WIDTH=304></p></CENTER> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And that's what showed up! <BR/> <BR/> From then on they got into fractals, strange attractors, etc. (See one of the many Chaos books 
  for a better explanation. Remember, this is a &quot;little&quot; theory.)</p>
