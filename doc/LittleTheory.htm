  <P><font face="Arial" size="2">This all started years ago when I saw a NOVA special about Chaos. &nbsp;They told a little story like this...</font></P>  <P><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Take a piece of paper and put three points on it, in a triangle. Label the points 1, 2, and 3. &nbsp;Now close your eyes and randomly put a point somewhere on the page. &nbsp;Next take your three sided die and roll it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Draw another point half way from your random point, and the point you rolled. &nbsp;(If you rolled a 3 go half way to point three from your random point.)&nbsp; Now roll the die again and go half way to the next point from your last point.<BR> <BR> Keep doing this and see what you get. &nbsp;To speed things up, we've had a computer simulate this and let's take a look.&quot;</font></P>  <CENTER><P><font face="Arial" size="2"><IMG SRC="random4.gif" HEIGHT=296 WIDTH=304></font></P></CENTER>  <P><font face="Arial" size="2">And that's what showed up!&nbsp; <BR> <BR> From then on they got into fractals, strange attractors, etc.&nbsp; (See one of the many Chaos books for a better explanation. &nbsp;Remember, this is a &quot;little&quot; theory.)</font></P>
